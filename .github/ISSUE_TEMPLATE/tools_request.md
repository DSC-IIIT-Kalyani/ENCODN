#### Feature Request:
It would be nice to have a tool like XYZ in ENCODN

#### Solution required:
1. Add a .py file with the named **XYZ.py** and add a function definition by the name **solve(parameters)** that takes in a parameters required as input and returns the output in a variable or displays it in an entry box that you import from the XYZ-FRAME.py file.
2. If possible (this is optional), in XYZ.py add another function definition by the name **generate(parameters)** that takes in parameters required and works opposite to the solve() function. Return "The entry/ies is/are incorrect!!!" in case of discrepancies.

#### Additional Info:
The file should be stored in the **ENCODN/ENCODN/TOOLS/ABC/DEF/** directory only, the filename, function name should be as specified above (case sensitive).

(Delete this portion in brackets before submitting the issue. Please set the title as Introduce XYZ tool and kindly check the headings in dcode.fr to identify the directory path)
