####Feature Request:
It would be nice to have a hashing algorithm like PQR in ENCODN

####Solution required:
1. Add a .py file with the named **XYZ.py** and add a function definition by the name **encrypt(String)** that takes in a plaintext string as input and returns the PQR encrypted string.
2. In XYZ.py add another function definition by the name **decrypt(String)** that takes in a PQR encypted string and returns the plaintext string corresponding to it. Return "The entered hash/cypher/value is incorrect!!!" in case of discrepancies.

####Additional Info:
The file should be stored in the **ENCODN/ENCODN/TOOLS/ABC/DEF/** directory only, the filename, function name should be as specified above (case sensitive).

(Delete this portion in brackets before submitting the issue. Please set the title as Introduce PQR hash/cypher/converter and kindly check the headings in dcode.fr to identify the directory path)
