# ENCODN

This is a simple Python3 GUI based user interface that simply takes in inputs from the user and encrypts/decrypts according to the algorithm chosen. The original idea is based on [dcode.fr](https://dcode.fr/), you can refer to the link for an overview.
The module used to implement this is Tkinter which is easy to learn.

This is perfect for new contributors who want to make **meaningful PR's** and are familiar with basic Python3. Please check the contributing.md file for rules and ideas about possible contributions.
